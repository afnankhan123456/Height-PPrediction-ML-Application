# Hight-PPrediction-ML-Application
This project leverages machine learning to predict an individualâ€™s height based on physical attributes such as shoe size, arm weight, age, and leg length. By analyzing these features from the training dataset, the model learns underlying patterns and provides accurate height predictions for new inputs.
